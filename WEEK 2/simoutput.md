reg-A reg (register) is a data object, which is holding the value from one procedural assignment to next one and are used only in different functions and procedural blocks.

wire-Wires are used for connecting different elements. They can be treated as physical wires. They can be read or assigned. No values get stored in them. 

dut- design under test

initial begin- initial block when the simulation time is 0 unit

assign- Logic for output is assigned to the inputs

XOR(^)-finds the xor operation between two inputs.If both the inputs are same then it is 0 if the inputs are different it results in 1.
